        <h1>My Experience</h1>
	<h2>GE Aviation Systems</h2>
  <p>
    As my experience at GE Aviation was primarily constructed of rotational programs, I've included a few key roles 
    here that were part of the program and beyond.
  </p>
	<h3>Time-Sensitive Networking Switch Application Developer</h3>
	<h4>January 2020 - Present</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li>
      Devised a Python-based implementation of IEEE standards for Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and Precision Time
      Protocol (PTP) for use on next-generation avionics switches.
    </li>
	  <li>
      Created a C-based interface application to expose Broadcom-proprietary embedded API calls to the Linux application level.
    </li>
	  <li>
      Implemented an inter-process socket framework for UDP-based communication between Python and C applications.
    </li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Civil UAS Embedded Developer & DevOps Engineer</h3>
	<h4>July 2018 - August 2019</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li>
      Developed flight and control law software for embedded application of a civil-application drone autopilot.
    </li>
	  <li>
      Mined telemetry logs and analyzed flight characteristics of actual flight test data.
    </li>
	  <li>
      Standardized development platform for a team of UAS developers to eliminate the “works on my machine” problem.
    </li>
	  <li>
      Created a continuous integration framework utilizing a Gazebo simulation environment for automated testing.
    </li>
	</ul>
	<h3>UI Developer</h3>
	<h4>July 2017 - July 2018</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li>
      Developed and tested the underlying mechanisms for GE’s next generation FMS UI features (Ada/VectorCAST).
    </li>
	  <li>
      Analyzed, verified, and validated formal test procedures and their failures for legacy FMS projects.
    </li>
	  <li>
      Organized scrum development configuration for task assignment and ran daily progress reporting.
    </li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Infra-Engineering Co-op/Intern</h3>
	<h4>Rotational: August 2013 - August 2016</h4>
	  <p>This was a series of five separate roles as part of the GE Aviation Intern program. As these were internships, 
        the experience was largely surface level, but I've chosen to call out two roles here that were particularly useful:
    </p>
	<h4>Analytics Research and Solutions Engineer</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li>
      Generated, validated, and provided datasets to quantify and indicate First Time Yield, Nonconformances, Scrap and
      Rework, and Out of Box Failures to be reported via Spotfire visualization dashboards.
    </li>
    <li>
      Identified issues within Electronics Value Stream sites’ data schemas and prescribed solutions that ranged from directly
      addressing processes to manually compiling reports or PostgreSQL queries to rectify data.
    </li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Advanced Common Modeling Environment (ACME) Web Developer</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li>
      Created a web based interface for users to interact with an Enterprise Architect driven database.
    </li>
    <li>
      Increased autonomy of data entry processes and diagram creation for customer presentation through use of jQueryUI and
      yFiles libraries in Javascript.
    </li>
    <li>
      Implemented back-end server and database interfacing with PHP and MSSQL to retrieve, update, and delete entries from
      tables with minimal user interaction.
    </li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Web Programming Interface Project</h2>
	<h3>Back-End Development Lead</h3>
	<h4>August 2014 - December 2014</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li>As part of Purdue University's Vertically Integrated Project program under Dr. Yung-Hsiang Lu, worked as a team member to design a web programming interface for the Advanced C Programming course in the Computer Engineering department.</li>
	  <li>Development was done in Python and Bash to interface with a web server built in Django.</li>
	  <li>Implemented ground-up design techniques: Sketch-to-Code technique.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Advanced C Programming Teaching Staff</h2>
	<h3>Undergraduate Teaching Assistant</h3>
	<h4>May 2014 - December 2014</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li>Assisted instructors Aaron Michaux, Alexander Quinn, and Yung-Hsiang Lu in the operation of class, exam administration, and answering student questions.</li>
	  <li>Oversaw assignment and exam grading as well as assigned lab office hours.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Rochem Membrane Systems, Inc.</h2>
	<h3>Summer Intern</h3>
	<h4>June 2012 - August 2012</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li>Assisted in conducting laboratory studies for the performance of Reverse Osmosis membranes to treat industrial wastewater.</li>
	  <li>Performed general office duties supporting service technicians.</li>
	</ul>
